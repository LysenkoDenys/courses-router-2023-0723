React Project-2 for the React Course

The application is a course-site project that allows you navigate pages with courses and sort suggested courses by title, slug, id:

https://courses-router-sort.vercel.app/

Sample:

![console](https://github.com/LysenkoDenys/courses-router-2023-0723/assets/105970854/d5855442-606a-4e1e-b304-8f7269c6c7a6)

This React JS project not uses API - we use dummy array of (objects) courses.

also add dropdown menu synchronized with navigation bar and add new component Dropdown.jsx for this.
